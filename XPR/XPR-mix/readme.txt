This project has an older mix of implementations of XPR version 0 and version 1. Some features:
- graphical interface (for XPR-1)
- hand-made recursive-descent versions of the parsers
- each parser has a simples 'alpha' version (without any kind of translation) thought to be given as examples for the students
- the fuller version of the parser were not usually given to them
